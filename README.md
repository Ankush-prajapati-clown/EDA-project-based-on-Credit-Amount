# EDA-project-based-on-Credit-Amount

### **Project Summary: Credit Amount EDA Case Study**  

#### **1. Objectives**  
The primary goal of this case study is to perform **Risk Analytics** using **data wrangling and visualization techniques** in Python. The objective is to derive insights that help a bank identify characteristics of **bad loan applications** (i.e., loans that are delayed or not paid).  

#### **2. Dataset Used**  
- The dataset contains **loan application records** for **~307,000 applications**.  
- It includes attributes related to applicant details, loan amount, repayment status, and other relevant financial data.  

#### **3. Methodologies Followed**  
- **Data Wrangling**: Cleaning and preprocessing the dataset to remove inconsistencies, missing values, and outliers.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identifying key trends, patterns, and relationships in the data through visualizations and statistical summaries.  
- **Risk Factor Identification**: Determining characteristics that differentiate **good loans** from **bad loans** based on historical data.  
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features that enhance the analysis and improve interpretability.  

#### **4. Analytical Techniques Used**  
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and distribution analysis.  
- **Data Visualization**: Using **Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly** for histograms, box plots, correlation heatmaps, etc.  
- **Correlation Analysis**: Identifying relationships between variables to find factors influencing bad loans.  
- **Outlier Detection**: Detecting unusual loan amounts or repayment behaviors.  
- **Segmentation Analysis**: Categorizing customers based on their credit risk profiles.

### **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  

#### **1. Objective**  
The purpose of this notebook is to conduct **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a given dataset. The analysis focuses on understanding the dataset’s structure, identifying key insights, and preparing data for further processing or modeling.  

#### **2. Dataset Used**  
The specific dataset is not explicitly mentioned in the preview, but the notebook includes steps for:  
- **Loading the dataset**  
- **Checking its shape and data types**  
- **Generating summary statistics**  

#### **3. Methodologies Followed**  
The notebook follows a structured EDA process, including:  
- **Data Preprocessing**  
  - Handling missing values  
  - Detecting and treating outliers  
- **Data Understanding**  
  - Checking dataset shape, types, and summary statistics  
- **Data Visualization**  
  - Identifying patterns and relationships through graphs  

#### **4. Analytical Techniques Used**  
- **Descriptive statistics**: Understanding distributions, mean, median, mode, and variance  
- **Missing value analysis**: Identifying and handling NaN values  
- **Outlier detection**: Using statistical techniques to detect anomalies  
- **Visualization techniques**: Histograms, box plots, scatter plots, and correlation heatmaps  

#### **5. EDA Process Overview**  
The notebook outlines a **step-by-step approach to EDA**, which includes:  
1. **Loading the dataset**  
2. **Checking the dataset’s shape** (number of rows and columns)  
3. **Exploring data types** (categorical vs. numerical)  
4. **Generating summary statistics**  
5. **Preprocessing the data** (handling missing values and outliers)  
6. **Visualizing the data** (various charts and plots)  
7. **Extracting insights from the analysis**
